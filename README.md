# Melio Candidates

Welcome to the Melio Candidates app.
This is a simple app which displays randomly generated candidates data in a list, using the `randomuser.me` API. In this app you can choose your favorite candidates and see them in the favorite's page.

### My Addition

1. Local app is available at `http://localhost:3000/` by using `Navigate` component.
2. You can `unFavorite` a candidate by click again on the heart icon.
3. Create `CardList` component that represents the list of the candidates.

### My Experience

At first it was hard for me to start working with technologies that I'm not familiar with, but while working on the app, I gained knowledge and confidence.
The task included new techniques for me that I definitely learned for later on.
I really enjoyed doing this task and solving this challenge, thank you for the opportunity!
