# Melio Task
While working on the task, I thought of some new ideas that in my opinion would be great additions to the app, so I added the following:

- Local app is available at http://localhost:3000/ by using `Navigate` component.
- You can  now also `un-favorite` a candidate by clicking the heart icon for a second time.
- Created the `CardList` component, which displays the candidates list, in order to avoid code duplication across the `Home.jsx` and `Favorite.jsx` pages.

### My Experience
Working with technologies that I'm not familiar with was a bit difficult at first, but while working on the app I feel that I gained knowledge and confidence.
The task introduced me to new techniques that I definitely learned for later on.
All in all, I really enjoyed working on this task and solving this challenge, thank you for the opportunity! :heart_eyes:
